---------------------------------------

- given text file has Forex bid and ask data for a month
- data for comparison will be 0.5*(bid+ask)
- pattern rely on percentage change of data from time (t) to (t+1)
- currentPattern method will store the latest 30 points 
- next we will store patterns for 30 consecutive points to predict result (t+30) in future
- next will come pattern recognition. If percentage change is 30% in agreement then pattern will be accepted
- For all 30 points if similarity is in 70% range we will accept the pattern
- predicted outcome is calculated and matched to actual outcome
- presently successful + conservative probility is 68% whereas failed prediction is ~32%
